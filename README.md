# Chip8 Emulator written in ruby

This project is part of what will hopefully be a series of emulators. It's always been a bucket list item of mine to build a gameboy emulator. So to learn how emulators work, I'm starting with a baisc chip8 emulator (interpreter to be more specific).

## Why Ruby?
I chose to write this in ruby because the chip8 is very small and doesn't need much to run. Since Ruby is my daily driver, I'm more familiar with it and can focus on learning more about how emulators work than learning C/C++ or rust. In the future I plan to write my emulators in either C or rust.
